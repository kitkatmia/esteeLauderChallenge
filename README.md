# Kode with Klossy: 2022 Estee Lauder Challenge

## Directions
Re-design and re-build their mobile app to promote new line of products

## Parameters
* Use the photo assets provided by the Estée team - they can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kT6mgTUHuqKdc5Z88VdrZ2Jn4CAxpgPY "Named link title"). You can use them all or choose a subset of them to use on your app!
* Build in at least one fun and/or unique feature to differentiate it from what others may submit. Get creative! Remember, the goal is to help promote this line of products. How can you get your users excited about this line?
* Think carefully about the design decisions you make. You’ll be asked to share your rationale for those decisions by reflecting on some questions in the submission form.

## Features included
* Imported app icon
* Tab bar at bottom to navigate between pages
* Scroll View on home page!
* Utilized mapKit and UIKit libraries to create a page where...
  * User can search for places in search bar (placeholder set as Estee Lauder)
  * Actually searches for places nearby and shows search results
  * On tap, takes user to location
  * On click, user is redirected to apple maps and given directions to said location
* 2 quizes with customized output ("Are you a match for this line of products?", "Which product is right for you?") 

## Future Iterations
* Fix constraints!
  * Constraints were a major struggle for me (as reflected on the home page). Given more time, I would straighten everything out and generally make the design easy on the eyes on all devices
* Better map integration
  * Take user's exact location -- results should be as accurate as possible
* Integrate Estee Lauder API (if there is one) into a new page
  * So people can buy the products and find out more information about them directly from the app
  * Improve efficency; no need to be redirected to the website, research for the product AND THEN buy it
 
## All built over the span of 5 days!
